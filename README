# Running/Debugging c++ application using clion + docker

This project demonstrates how to run a c++ application remotely on a container.

It is inspired by excellent guide provided:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55272484/how-to-code-run-programs-in-a-docker-container-using-clion`

It expects the `docker plugin` for clion has been installed.

## Running

Simply select Run->Debug / Run->Release.

As there is a single `toolchain` pointing to `local container`, all `cmake` builds (Release/Debug) run on the remote container.
